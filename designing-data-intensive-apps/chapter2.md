## **Data Models and Query Languages**
Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another. Each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by providing a clean model. These abstractions allow different grouops of people to work together effectively

###Relational Model vs Document Model
The roots of relational databases lie in *business data processing, transaction processing, and batch processing*. The goal was to hide implementation detail behind a cleaner interface.

Driving forces behind adoption of NoSQL or *Not Only SQL* databases:
- greater scalability involving very large datasets or very high throughput
- open source software >> commercial database products
- specialized query operations
- desire for dynamic and expressive data model
